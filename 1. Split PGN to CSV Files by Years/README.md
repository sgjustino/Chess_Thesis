# Dataset: The dataset contains 2.2 million games from ChessBase Mega Database 2023 and spans from 2015 to 2021. Data was received by Justin Ong from Dr. Nemanja Vaci as a PGN file via G.drive.

# Info: The first step constitutes an effort to use pgn2data library to convert the pgn dataset to game info files and moves files. Due to the huge dataset and memory-intensive coding, the process is done in year batches.

# Environment: Kaggle Notebooks (Python 3.10.13, 7 instances of 30gb memory ram each)
