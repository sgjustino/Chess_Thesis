# Dataset: Data taken from step 2 - filtered middle games files

# Info: With the filtered middle game data, we first extracted all possible constellations, resulting in 89,483,468 unique constellations across the 2.2 million games. To retain the most relevant patterns and ensure computational feasibility, a frequency threshold was applied to focus on constellations that appeared more than 20 times across all games, thus excluding extremely rare patterns. In the same step, we calculated the IDF scores for the remaining constellations.
