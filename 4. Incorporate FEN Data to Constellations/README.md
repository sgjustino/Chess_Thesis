# Dataset: Data taken from step 3 filtered constellations.

# Info: In order to calculate immediate game outcomes and other complexity scores, we extracted the FEN positions of the constellations (moves files extracted in step 1 via pgn2data library) and their immediate 20 moves to the filtered constellation data (step 3). The different year files are then combined together.

# Environment: Kaggle Notebooks (Python 3.10.13, 8 instances of 30gb memory ram each)
